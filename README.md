# XL (eXperimental Language)

Experiments with designing and implementing a programming language. Goal is to learn how 
to design and implement a programming. Feature ideas are drawn from OO and FP, with a 
desire for correctness, low cognitive overhead for the user, and expressiveness/conciseness 
without being incomprehensibly dense.

My design inspirations are mostly modern OO/FP languages that reduce "foot-gun" potential 
and increase program correctness. Kotlin, Pony, Cone, Rust, Idris, Haskell come to mind at 
the moment; there are many others. 

## Philosophy
Programming is *hard*. We're not good at it. (Most of us.) Programming languages and the ecosystem 
in which they live should make it easy to write correct programs.

We read code much more than we write it. So reading code should be easy on the eyes and brain.

## Shortlist
* Add parens to function definition
* Use type inference to determine function parameter types
* Add a `String` type
* Lazy evaluation
