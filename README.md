# XL (eXperimental Language)

Experiments with designing and implementing a programming language. My current goals are to learn how to implement a programming language. Feature ideas are drawn from OO and FP, with a desire for 
correctness, low cognitive overhead for the user, and expressiveness/conciseness without being incomprehensibly dense.

My design inspirations are mostly modern languages that reduce "foot-gun" potential and increase program correctness. Kotlin, Pony, Cone, Rust, Idris, Haskell come to mind at the moment; there are 
many others.
